# QueryPDF ðŸ’¬

QueryPDF is a web application designed to enhance document analysis by intelligently retrieving relevant sentences based on user queries. Traditional search methods often miss nuanced information in documents, requiring exact keyword matches. QueryPDF overcomes this limitation using advanced sentence transformer models to identify contextually relevant sentences, even when specific keywords are absent.

## Features

- **Contextual Search:** Search for topics of interest without needing exact keyword matches.
- **Intelligent Analysis:** Utilizes advanced models to identify and extract relevant information.
- **Efficient Retrieval:** Presents a sorted list of the most pertinent sentences from uploaded documents.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple upload interface with query input for seamless operation.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Document:** Upload your PDF document of interest.
2. **Enter Query:** Specify your query or topic, such as "sustainable practices"
3. **Retrieve Results:** QueryPDF scans the document, identifies contextually similar sentences, and presents them in a sorted list.
