      " Most recently in Birmingham, Ariarne achieved a clean sweep with three individual gold medals in 200m, 400m and 800m freestyle, in addition to a gold medal for her relay team that won the 4 x 200m Freestyle relay.\n",

      " Ariarne, at 22 years old, finished all 3 of her individual events with Commonwealth Games records holding the status of one of the most dominant freestyle swimmers in the world as well as being the first athlete in 50 years to take out all 3 gold medals in the Commonwealth Games woman’s freestyle.\n",
      "\n",
      " In addition, Ariarne broke Katie Ledecky’s long standing 400m Freestyle World Record at the 2022 Australian Championships, placing her as one of the all-time middle distance greats.\n",

      " Ariarne isn’t shy of a challenge and has become an inspirational figure, with the highest engagement figures out of all Australian swimmers.\n",
      "\n",
      " Ariarne has proven to be an insightful speaker and a humble role model to future generations quoting in a post-game interview “I’m just from a small town in Tassie and this goes to show that if you believe you can do something you can 100% do it if you work for it”.\n",
      "\n",
      " Ariarne also as gracious in defeat as she is in victory quoting “If I went to the Olympics and didn’t win gold in the 400 but I swam the time I did, I would’ve still been happy because I would have swum the best that I could, it just hadn’t been enough on that day”.\n",
